            TechMids Conf is an inclusive event to celebrate and explore the
            great technical talent across the region, so we don’t want you
            spending the day anxious about covid, we want you to be having fun!

            To ensure the event is as safe as possible for all in attendance we
            are taking the following precautions and ask that you help us by
            cooperating with them.

          </h2>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
            When you arrive we will do the following:
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
            Check your temperature
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
            We will do this by using a “thermometer gun,” a device that is
            equipped with an infrared sensor that can quickly measure surface
            temperature without making any contact with a person&rsquo;s skin.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
            Ask you to provide proof of at least three Covid vaccinations
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-gray-500">
            You can do this via the paper card you carry in your wallet or by
            showing us your digital “NHS Covid Pass”. To get the NHS Covid Pass
            you’ll need to register on the NHS App and download it to your phone
            ahead of time. To register, the process takes around 5-10 mins but
            it can take up to 24 hours for the NHS to process so please do this
            ahead of time. You can then save the pass into your digital wallet
            for easy access.
